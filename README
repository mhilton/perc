perc is a simple utility that indicates how much of a file has been processed.

It is designed for use in long running pipelines to give some clue as to how 
far through it is. perc copies data from stdin to stdout outputting a 
percentage complete and expected remaining time on stderr.

Usage:
  perc [size]

if size is omitted, or is not a number, perc will still copy from stdin to 
stdout, but it will not output the progress information.
